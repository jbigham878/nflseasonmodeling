## NFL Playoff Projection Modeling
### Project Overview

In the NFL, it all comes down to how a team performs in the playoffs. The previous 17 regular season games determine who makes the playoffs, but once they begin, the whole season is on the line.

The teams with the best records in the regular season often have the higher chances of making it farther in the payoffs and eventually the Super Bowl - but can we predict how far a team will make it in the playoffs based off of their statistics from the regular season?
